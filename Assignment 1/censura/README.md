# Censura

## Background

Hacktivist group Th3_0ffi5 encrypted all our stationery files.

An anonymous tipster left clues to retrieve the decryption key, but the audio got corrupted :(

Can you help us recover the information within our documents?

(This wouldn't have happened if they were printed on paper :( )

(In this exercise the flag does NOT start with CC5325. You will find the flag in an image.)
