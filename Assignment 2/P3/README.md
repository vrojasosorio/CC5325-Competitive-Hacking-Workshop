## Background

I asked a friend who is learning to make web pages to make me a web page to share messages, but I told him to limit a little the things that could be sent.

Looks like he's been playing a lot lately 😐 So he didn't put as much love into it.

He told me that he left a couple of hidden messages, but he really gave me laziness. 

Let's see if you can help me.
